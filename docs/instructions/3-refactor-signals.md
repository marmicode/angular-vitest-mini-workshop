# Refactoring to Angular Signals

## Setup

Navigate to the third exercise:

```sh
pnpm cook start 3-refactor-signals
```

## 🎯 Goal: Refactor Component to Use Angular Signals

In this exercise, you'll modernize the `RecipeSearch` component by refactoring from traditional RxJS/subscription patterns to Angular's new reactive primitives: signals and `rxResource`.

### 📝 Steps

#### 1. Run tests

```sh
pnpm test
```

#### 2. Checkout the new implementation of `RecipeSearch`

```sh
pnpm cook checkout-impl
```

#### 3. Analyze which tests are failing

#### 4. Fix the tests
